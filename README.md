# Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors
An introduction to the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm developed for the Machine Learning Club at ASU

This introduction shows how to develop the algorithm and how to develop a tool to leverage the algorithm.

This intro was developed for Google Colab, and has not been tested on Jupyter notebook. Running either of these files outside of Google Colab might produce  unexpected outputs.
